# Sentiment Analysis and Predictive Modeling of User Reviews Across Dating Apps: A Comparative Study of Boo, Bumble, Hinge, and Tinder

This project analyses reviews from dating apps to identify trends in user satisfaction and develop a predictive model for rating classification. Data from 240,000 reviews across four apps—Boo, Bumble, Hinge, and Tinder—are examined to understand sentiment differences and version-wise changes. Therefore, my research questions are as follows:

1. How do the sentiment of reviews differ across dating apps and change over versions?
2. How well can we classify the score a user has given the app based on the content of the review?
